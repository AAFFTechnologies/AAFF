<p>
Let's get right to it. Are you a current or retired/veteran member of the United States Armed Forces? Check. Do you often speak in military lingo to your friends, and they have no clue what you're saying? Check. (As veteran's ourselves, we know we do). Do you like all of your military related information in one clutter free, beautifully crafted place? Check. Do you want to be able to find any service member using the app easily? Check. Do you like to stay in connection with your other military family effortlessly, both on a *LIVE* updating stream (separated by just your branch, or by all branches), and through easy to send/receive messages? Check.

That's like 5 checks already, and you haven't even used the app yet. 

You're still sitting there? Download A.A.F.F now and join the military friendly environment you're most familiar with TODAY!</p>

<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing.

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating pages manually</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
